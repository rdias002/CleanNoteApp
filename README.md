# CleanNoteApp

A Note takking app developed using Clean Architecture and Jetpack Compose

> Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels. An important goal of clean architecture is to provide developers with a way to organize code in such a way that it encapsulates the business logic but keeps it separate from the delivery mechanism.

This project has been divided into the following layers:

1. Data Layer -> Responsible for data fetching from database
2. Domain Layer -> Defines the use case and business logic for the module
3. Presentation Layer -> Defines the UI and interactions user can have with the UI
